## Activity 2

### Question 1
Scripts is the list of commands and what they do. Dependencies and devDependencies are lists of the installed libraries in this project and their versions.
The commands that can be run are listed under scripts.

### Question 2
index.html is the webpage that loads. It initializes the file as an html document, gives the page a head and body, and includes a script tag that loads the JavaScript.
The script tag loads the JavaScript.
It renders the JavaScript through importing it and calling `render()` to use it.

### Question 3
The definition of the element and the object's location are different to make it easier to add more later on and keep track of your objects/definitions, and it makes it possible to have multiple instances of one object. It also helps to ensure that the object that was created is not changed by accident.

### Question 4
Lit helps to quickly build web components that are universal and open-source. This is so special because it is so universal, anyone can use and view them.
